# Travel-Expense

App for Android OS that allows user to track any expenses he makes during trips, whether personal or buisness.
Code in SRC folder, APK in bin directory and the UML diagram can be found in the DOC folder.

All features required for the app are present with the exception of DATA PERSISTENCE. i was not able to figure out how to properly implement it so that I could save.  I do not think i was iniializing the file right, but I ran out of time.
features;

Add/remove/edit claim
Add/delete expenses

email claim with all its expenses
change status of a claim so that no one can edit it any more.
